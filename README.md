# Data Acquisition System

Here you can find everything about my final degree proyect, all the code, desings and PCB files can be found on the repository. Here is a summary of the proyect:


## General Diagram
The general diagram of the DAQ could be simplified as:

Collected data will be avaliable in a [web developed for this purpose](https://tfg-sergio-gasquez.onlosant.com/) (An amazing IoT platform!)

## Prototypes
Two prototypes have been developed:

## Analog Conditioning
There are two analog conditioning parts:
- Amplifier

Also, the MAX743 is used to power all the OP Amps in his typical configuration.

## Final product

This is the end result:

The thesis can be also found in the repo, but sadly had to write it in spanish. If you have any doubt feel free to ask without hessitation!
